    <p contenteditable="true">Dear BTA,</p> 
    <p contenteditable="true">Annyeong my 19-y-o girl. Perhaps this is the first birthday away from you since we met, isn't it? From a distant land, spanning thousands of miles, I extend my sincere wishes for a year filled with luck, success, and joy. My cherished girl has undergone significant changes in the past year, much like both of us. University life has that effect, doesn't it? Thankfully, it seems we've both grown into better versions of ourselves and still have each other. Here's to hoping the coming years follow suit.</p>
